Play Chess on the Terminal. that's it.

Use the Arrow keys to select/move pieces.
```
Q - Exit game.
ENTER - Select Area.
Up - move cursor up.
Down - move cursor down.
Right - move cursor to the right.
Left - move cursor to the left.
```
Piece list : 
```
p - pawn   ♟
r - rook   ♜
b - bishop ♝
k - knight ♞
Q - Queen  ♚
K - King   ♛
```
This is what the game looks like : 

```
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
0 r b k Q K k b r 
1 p p p p p p p p 
2 # # # # # # # #
3 # # # # # # # #
4 # # # # # # # #
5 # # # # # # # #
6 p p p p p p p p 
7 r b k Q K k b r
```
(it looks much better on the terminal trust me)
