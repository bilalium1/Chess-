# Chess-
Play Chess on the Terminal. that's it.

Use the Arrow keys to select/move pieces.
```
Q - Exit game.
ENTER - Select Area.
Up - move cursor up.
Down - move cursor down.
Right - move cursor to the right.
Left - move cursor to the left.
```
Piece list : 
```
p - pawn   ♟
r - rook   ♜
b - bishop ♝
k - knight ♞
Q - Queen  ♚
K - King   ♛
```
This is what the game looks like : 

```
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
0 r b k Q K k b r 
1 p p p p p p p p 
2 # # # # # # # #
3 # # # # # # # #
4 # # # # # # # #
5 # # # # # # # #
6 p p p p p p p p 
7 r b k Q K k b r
```
(it looks much better on the terminal trust me)

# How to Play :
- Clone the rep :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bilalium1/Chess-.git
```
- follow the instructions below depending on your OS.
## Windows ( beta male ) : 
- just run the .exe file mate
```bash
./main.exe
```
## Linux ( gigachad )
- pretty obvious
```bash
./main.out
```
- this also works for Mactards

 ### if no main.exe/main.out
 - run make (make sure you have make installed)
```bash
make
```

Thanks for reading. :)
